      <p>Introduction</p>
      <p>
        Paintball is a competitive team shooting sport where players eliminate opponents from play by hitting them with spherical dye-filled capsules called paintballs. These paintballs break upon impact, and mark the opponent with paint. Paintballs are shot from paintball markers, which use compressed air or nitrogen as propellant.
        Paintball games are typically played on indoor or outdoor fields of varying size. Indoor fields are not common in the Pacific Northwest, where we live. Outdoor fields are far more common, and this is where you will find the South Hill Honey Badgers team.
        Paintball fields are populated with natural terrain (such as trees, underbrush, streams, and hills) as well as artificial obstacles (wooden bunkers, barricades and fortresses). Popular game objectives include variations of capture the flag, elimination, and scenario events.
      </p>
      <p>Paintguns</p>
      <p>
        Paintball markers come in a variety of shapes and styles and there are many manufacturers who offer widely avaialable markers. Entry level markers can be found for as low as $100, while high-end markers for the serious competitor can be over $2,000.
        These markers are powered by various gases. Carbon dioxide (CO2) was exclusively used when the sport first began and is still in use today, but usually with older marker systems or the low-end markers available for purchase. Nitrogen (N2) and compressed air/high pressure air (HPA) are the most commpon gas systems seen today.
        Most paintball markers use refillable cylinders called "tanks" or "bottles" that give you hundreds of shots before they need to be refilled.
        Some will use small 12 gram CO2 powerlets as their power source, which sustain 15-30 shots a piece. You will often find these used in pump-action paintball markers.
        These markers cycle a paintball into the chamber of the marker when the operator manually pumps the pump-action forward to open the chamber, allowing the painball to cycle into the chamber. The operator then manually moves the pump-action backward towards their body, closing the chamber and sealing the paintball round in the chamber.
        The trigger of the marker is then pulled and propellant is syphoned from the gas cylinder, into the chamber, propelling the paintball down the barrel and away from the operator.
      </p>
      <p>Most of the markers available and in popular use today are semi-automatic. You must cock the paintball marker for the first shot, but after the first shot, the marker cycles a new paintball into the chamber after the trigger is pulled.
        This is accomplished via either mechanical or electronic methods. Below is an outline of basic components of a paintball marker
      </p>
      <p>The Components of a Basic Paintball Marker</p>
      <p>A modern paintball marker is a remarkable technological machine, the sum of dozens of components, parts and assemblies that all work together to shoot paintballs and power the game we love! From basic mechanical paintball guns at the hundred-dollar level, to high-end, electronic paintball guns costing over a thousand dollars, most paintball guns share a similar design that players of the game have come to know and understand.
      </p>
      <p>Receiver (main body): 
        The receiver is the main body of a paintball marker generally made of metal such as aluminum. The receiver is attached to the grip frame, usually with two screws or thumbs
      </p>
      <p>Grip Fame: 
        The grip frame houses the trigger mechanism, handgrips and the trigger safety, as well as electronic circuit boards, information screens, buttons and batteries in many electronic paintball guns. Some modern paintball guns even route air through the grip frame as a replacement for external hoses that could snag or fail.
      </p> 
      <p>Air Source Adapter: 
        The air source adapter, sometimes called a bottle adapter, mounts to the bottom of the grip frame, and is the attachment point for the air bottle used to provide power to fire paintballs and re-cock the paintball gun. Many modern paintball guns offer an on/off bottle adapter, allowing players to turn air power on and off without removing the bottle.
      <p>Ball Detent: 
        The ball detent (anti-double feed) is a small spring-like piece that holds each paintball in place in the gun's breech inside the receiver while it is waiting to fire, preventing another paintball from trying to feed that may cause jams or broken paintballs.
      </p>
      <p>Feed Neck/Hopper Adapter: 
        The feed neck or hopper adapter of a paintball gun is located at the top of the paintball gun's receiver near the front, just above the breech. This is the attachment point for a hopper or loader that feeds paintballs into the paintball gun for firing. Many modern paintball guns are equipped with an adjustable, or clamping hopper adapter that prevents the loader from falling off during play.
      </p>
      <p>Barrel: 
        The barrel's purpose is to allow gas coming from the C02 or high-pressure tank time to push the ball forward and send it into flight and onto the player's target accurately. The barrel threads into the main body at the front.
      <p>Foregrip/Regulator: 
        The foregrip is located at the bottom front portion of the paintball gun's receiver, in front of the grip frame, allowing a player to stabilize the paintball gun during firing by providing a solid grip for the shooter’s off-hand. Many modern electronic paintball guns house an air pressure regulator inside this foregrip.
      </p>
      <p>Bolt/Sear/Hammer: 
        In mechanical paintball guns, the bolt is located within the gun's main body. When you cock the gun, the bolt is pulled back where it is engaged by the sear. When the trigger is pulled the sear is tripped. A spring forces the hammer back into the rear end of the power tube, releasing the gas that propels the ball.
      </p>
      <p>Electronic Marker Bolt/Drive Assembly: 
        Electronic markers don't use the basic spring and hammer design of mechanical guns. Instead, a solenoid is used to route the air when the trigger is pulled. Spool valves and poppet valves are used in electronic markers in the place of a power tube used in basic mechanical paintball guns.

      <h3>Upcoming Events</h3>
      <p>
      The South Hill Honey Badgers is a Woodsball Team, which means we play in the great outdoors on a variety of fields.
      We have two locations that we primarily play on, one located just outside of Greenwater, WA off Forest Service Road #70, and the other is private property in Buckley, WA.
      </p>
      <p>
      We also attend SuperGame in St. Paul, Oregon every year. This is one of the largest paintball events in the Pacific Northwest. We invite you to join us there!</p>
      <p>

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
      We are a group of friends who have been playing together for 15 years. We started out as a few fathers with their kids once a month, playing paintball together in the woods.
      We now regularly have groups of 20+ each month when we gather to play. We have 32 variant games that we play and on occasion we design our own scenario games.
      </p>
      <p>Are you interested in playing with us?</p>
