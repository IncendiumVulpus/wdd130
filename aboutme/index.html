    <h2>Allen Whaley</h2>
    <p>I am married, with two children. I enjoy playing paintball and Dungeons & Dragons.
    I have been married for almost 23 years, and my wife and I are about to send our last
    child off to college. We will all be in college at the same time!</p>
    <p>I work in downtown Seattle, and on days that I travel to the office, I wake up at 4am
    to catch the train. It makes for a long day, and I prefer to work from home!</p>
    <p>I am studying at BYU-Idaho, for a Bachelors of Applied Science, in Applied Technology.
    I do not have a college degree and it feels like that has held me back in my career.
    I hope that by getting a degree, I will be able to better provide for my family.</p>
